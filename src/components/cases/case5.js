          <h2>Kite: The ace of social media strategies</h2>
          <p>
            Have you seen the Kite social media strategy? We at Cheesecake were
            really excited to be working with them on this exciting project.
            This is something that we would love to get involved in in the
            future. We love a good challenge and this seems like it will
            certainly be a tough one.

          <h2>Build a strong presence</h2>
          <p>
            One of the problems you face when creating social media strategy for
            a client is how to structure everything in a way that different
            users can understand. Different people have different ways of
            perceiving and understanding things, so creating a unique strategy
            for each client is important.

          <h2>The social media hype!</h2>
          <p>
            For many businesses and brands, social media is one of the most
            effective tools available to reach new audiences and connect with
            existing fans and followers. However, many new and small businesses
            actually underestimate the power that can be unlocked by leveraging
            social media effectively.
